## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* I have explained acronyms
* Added references to my description
* Added the \value to my functions to explain their output
* Removed \dontrun{} from examples in functions

## Test environments
* local OS 11.15.2 install, R 4.1.1
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
