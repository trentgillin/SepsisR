Sepsis can present in many different ways. Many professionals recognize
sepsis’ presentation, but the literature is undecided when it comes to
an exact clinical definition. The purpose of this package is to provide
functions in order to make the process of identifying and analyzing
sepsis patients easier. The assess\_organ function is the main function
of this package; it allows you to assess organ failure using one of the
three common organ failure scores, SIRS, SOFA, and qSOFA. Currently, all
score vital thresholds are based off the MD Calc Website
(<https://www.mdcalc.com>). This package also has a few helper functions
including find\_bx\_window and find\_qad, from the CDC (Centers for
Disease and Control) definition of Sepsis. This package is not in anyway
supported by the CDC or Emory Healthcare.

## Installation

Get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trentgillin/Sepsis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(SepsisR)

assess_organ(sirs_data, method = "SIRS",
                 patientid = Encounter, 
                time = Service_Timestamp, 
                vitals = c("RR" = "RR", 
                           "WBC" = "Wbc", 
                    "Temperature" = "Temperature",
                    "HR" = "HR"))
#> # A tibble: 9 × 7
