Sepsis can present in many different ways. Many professionals recognize
sepsis' presentation, but the literature is undecided when it comes to an exact
clinical definition. The purpose of this package is to provide functions in order 
to make the process of identifying and analyzing sepsis patient data easier. `assess_organ` 
is the main function of this package; it allows you to assess organ failure using
one of the three common organ failure scores, SIRS, SOFA, and qSOFA.
Currently, all score vital thresholds are based off the MD Calc Website. Please view the description file to see MD Calc references for individual organ failure scores.
This package also has a few helper functions including `find_bx_window` and `find_qad`, 
from the CDC (Centers for Disease and Control) definition of Sepsis. 
This package is not in anyway supported by the CDC or Emory Healthcare. 

## Installation

Get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trentgillin/Sepsis")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SepsisR)

assess_organ(sirs_data, method = "SIRS",
				 patientid = Encounter, 
				time = Service_Timestamp, 
				vitals = c("RR" = "RR", 
				           "WBC" = "Wbc", 
					"Temperature" = "Temperature",
					"HR" = "HR"))
```
